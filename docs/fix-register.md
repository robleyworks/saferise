# SafeRise — fix register

Canonical record of defects and design decisions. Commits reference the ID:
`fix: SR-0NN …` or `feat: SR-0NN …`.

**Rules**
- Never renumber an existing ID.
- New items go at the bottom of their severity block with the next free number.
- The number is global — it does not restart per block.
- Highest ID currently issued: **SR-048**.

*Note: IDs SR-001 to SR-043 were tracked in an earlier artifact and covered work that
has since shipped. Numbering continues from SR-044 so no ID is ever reused.*

### SR-045 · Track accent tokens conflict between design system and dashboard
`css/saferise-system.css` defines `--sr-track02:#FF6FA8`, `--sr-track03:#5BC8D8`,
`--sr-track04:#B57BFF`. The member dashboard defined a parallel set `--t2:#E87090`,
`--t3:#4E9AA6`, `--t4:#9B7FD4`. `--t1` and `--sr-track01` agreed at `#D4A843`.
A member moving between the marketing site and the dashboard would see the same track
in two different hues.

**Resolution.** System values adopted as the single source of truth. Dashboard
duplicates removed; `saferise-system.css` now loads in `dashboard.html` before the
dashboard stylesheet. If a hue reads wrong on the dashboard's darker ground, change it
in `saferise-system.css` so both surfaces move together — never fork it back.

`--t1`–`--t4` deleted from the dashboard's `:root`; all ten usages repointed to
`var(--sr-track01..04)` across `css/saferise-dashboard.css` (the `--accent`
default) and the `TRACKS` / `JOURNEY` objects in `dashboard.html`. Loading the
system sheet exposed [[SR-048]].

### SR-046 · Class collisions between dashboard, index.html and the design system
- `.sr-hero`, `.sr-hero-title`, `.sr-hero-sub`, `.sr-hero-cta` are defined in both
  `index.html`'s inline style and the dashboard CSS, with different geometry.
- `.sr-player` carries 15 rules in `saferise-system.css`, including descendant
  selectors such as `.sr-player .exp-tabs`. The dashboard defines its own
  `.sr-player`.

Both were inert only because the two stylesheets never loaded together — a condition
SR-045 removes. Precedent: `.sr-dash-next`, dead code from a removed column, silently
restyled the carousel's next arrow into a 62×46 oval and went undetected until it
rendered.

**Resolution.** Dashboard classes namespaced to `sr-dash-hero*` and `sr-dash-player*`.
`index.html` and `saferise-system.css` untouched.

23 tokens renamed, 70 occurrences across `dashboard.html` (34) and
`css/saferise-dashboard.css` (36). The renames include the JS string literals
that build the hero slides and the `querySelectorAll('.sr-hero-slide')` /
`'.sr-hero-dot'` lookups, which is where a partial rename would have passed
static inspection and broken the slider at runtime. Verified live: four slides, four
dots, both arrows, dot↔slide index in sync, arrow wrap at both ends, and the
Clearing cover still opens `#mMedia` with `.sr-dash-player` styled by the
dashboard sheet.

### SR-047 · Mobile hero: theme toggle overlaps slide kickers below ~560px
At 390px the Midnight/Sunrise toggle occupies x 182–354, y 38–70. Hero kickers sit at
x 36, y 60–77. Slides 3 ("Opening 1 September") and 4 ("The SafeRise podcast") run
underneath it; slides 1 and 2 clear.

**Resolution.** Toggle leaves the hero below 560px and sits as a static right-aligned
row above it. Deliberately not fixed by reflowing the kickers — the hero is a rotating
slider, so clearance tuned to the current slides expires the moment a new one is added.

Implemented as a single `@media(max-width:560px)` block turning `.sr-themewrap`
static and right-aligned; the slider track then begins beneath it. Measured at
390px: toggle occupies y 22–66, track starts at y 66, and all four slides report
zero overlapping elements. At 561px the toggle is `position:absolute`, top 16px,
right 20px inside the hero — unchanged.

### SR-048 · System stylesheet's section padding is additive on the dashboard
Loading `saferise-system.css` (see [[SR-045]]) exposes
`section{padding-block:clamp(72px,9vw,128px)}`, written for the marketing page's
full-bleed bands. The dashboard spaces its sections with `margin-top:56px`, so the
padding is purely additive: 128px top and bottom across nine sections took the page
from 4737px to 6785px.

Three other system rules also began matching and were measured as harmless:
`section{position:relative;z-index:1}` (no stacking regression — nav rail 50, modals
80, sections 1, and the Cue Card still resolves topmost), `.eyebrow{letter-spacing:.38em}`
(the dashboard's `.24em` wins by cascade order — computed 2.64px either way), and
`.sr-cover` (dashboard rules already win on every property that affects the render).
`section{border-top:0!important}` cannot be overridden, but no `<section>` in the
dashboard draws a top border, so it lands on nothing.

**Resolution.** Neutralised locally with `section{padding-block:0}` in
`css/saferise-dashboard.css`, placed with the other reset rules near the top rather
than in the ALIGNMENT block, which stays single-purpose. The shared sheet is not
edited, so `index.html` is unaffected.

## BACKLOG

### SR-044 · Member dashboard integrated into the repo
Adds `dashboard.html`, `protocol.html` and `resource.html`. Styles extracted to
`css/saferise-dashboard.css`; hero image extracted to
`assets/dashboard/hero-corridor.jpg`. `index.html` untouched.

Two defects found and fixed during integration:
- Surplus `</div>` after the footer put div balance at −1.
- Selecting Elevation Series retained the previous track's paywall CTA
  ("Professional Performance is not on your plan yet… ADD FOR €49 / MONTH"), because
  the empty-track branch returned before the CTA-clearing block.
